### CITY OVERVIEW

With a population of about 1.3 million people, Milan is the capital of Lombardy, in the middle of the Po Valley, not far from the Alps and from the Italian largest lakes (Lake Como, Lake Maggiore, Lake Lugano). Milan is considered the Italian economic and financial center, as the most important industrial and financial businesses of the Country are settled here, along with the headquarters of the Stock Exchange. Milan also represents the Italian capital of fashion and design, as the most important Italian fashion “maisons” and international design fairs are located here. Among the most important fashion and design fairs held in Milan are the “Settimana della moda” (Milan Fashion Week) and the “Salone Internazionale del Mobile” (Milan Furniture Fair).

Of utmost importance for the cultural life in Milano is the “Teatro alla Scala” (La Scala Theater), which is considered the international “temple” of Opera music. The city also has numerous famous theatres for plays and musicals, such as the celebrated “Piccolo Teatro” founded by Giorgio Strehler. In Milano are also the headquarters of the main newspapers of national importance and coverage (“Corriere della Sera”, “Il Sole 24 Ore”,..); and the main Italian publishers (Mondadori, Feltrinelli, Garzanti, Rizzoli). 

In Milano, visitors can visit and enjoy a wide variety of monuments, museums and historical buildings of great architectural relevance. One of the most celebrated squares in Italy is the “Piazza del Duomo”, with its breathtaking Cathedral facing a beautiful pedestrian area and the famous “Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II”.

Milan hosted the non-commercial Universal Exposition in 2015. Expo2015, whose theme was “Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life”, featured more than 150 countries with about 20 million visitors and 5000 events. Not only an exhibition, but also a process of active participation among a large number of players around technology, innovation, culture, traditions and creativity and how they relate to food and diet. The success of Expo2015 lies in the huge variety of aromas, flavors and habits that have delighted visitors, along with the moving show offered by the Tree of Life. 
The Milan district offers a website dedicated to tourism and cultural events in the city: www.turismo.milano.it. From this website you can download a complete tourist guide to the city, available in different languages.
