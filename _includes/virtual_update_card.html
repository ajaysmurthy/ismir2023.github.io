  <p>Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, <b>ISMIR 2020 will be fully online</b>. The conference will occur October
    11â€“16 with 24 hr programming to facilitate accessibility and visibility across time zones, and in a virtual
    environment supporting the peer-to-peer discussions that ISMIR has long prioritized. The ISMIR 2020 team looks
    forward to welcoming our research community to a new conference experience. We plan to open the registration in the
    first week of August. More details to come.</p>
