summary: The Call for Tutorials of the 24th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference
---

The annual conference of the International Society for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) is the world’s leading research forum on processing, analyzing, searching, organizing and accessing music-related data. The 24th ISMIR conference, to be held in Milan, Italy from November 5-9 2023, welcomes proposals for tutorials to be given in conjunction with the conference. Tutorials take place at the start of the ISMIR conference, and this year will be held on Sunday, Nov 5, 2023. Each tutorial is allocated 3 hours to concentrate on a single topic, with tutorials taking place in parallel sessions. 
Tutorials are expected to be delivered in person for quality of experience. The ISMIR community, however, is very sensitive to issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion; and the ISMIR board and Organizing Committee are willing and ready to help presenters with specific needs (e.g. visa problems, parental leave, health or financial issues, etc.). We therefore encourage prospective tutorial presenters with such needs to reach out to the Tutorial Co-Chairs (ismir2023-tutorials@ismir.net) and discuss options (exceptions to the in-presence rule or possibility of financial support).
To make the conference more accessible and inclusive, in addition to the standard tutorial suggestions, we particularly welcome tutorial proposals which either cover fundamental and introductory topics in MIR, or present an informative and stimulating coverage of current MIR topics in a manner that is targeted towards people new to the field.
